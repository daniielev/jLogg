# jLogg, Facebook Login Plugin

### A simple plugin for loggin-in users

So, maybe you're building your own web-based app and you new to handle users' authentications. Reading docs are sometimes really boring and time is just not enough, you new to focus on other pieces of code. Here's where my plugin called "jLogg" comes to save you!

Built with jQuery, jLogg is able to bring you the well-know Facebook Login box, as their [Docs for Developers](https://developers.facebook.com/docs/javascript) says: *The Facebook SDK for JavaScript provides a rich set of client-side functionalities*.
